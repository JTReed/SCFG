**2D Action Platformer in Unity inspired by classic Megaman games**

My first game and currently in progess, SCFG (working title) is a small action platformer made using Unity's 2D tools. 

Goals for completion
- a full stage; complete with a boss at the end
- full art for characters, enemies, and a stage
- menu and stage music by electronic artist [Mr._Moose](https://soundcloud.com/mr-moose-6)

I'll add features as I progress!

Controls:
- Z to Shoot/Charge
- X to jump
- Down + X to slide 
Xbox 360 Controller supported
